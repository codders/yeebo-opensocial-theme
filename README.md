# Open Social Theme for Yeebo

Created by Beat and Arthur

## Changelog

- Added custom maintenance template with its own CSS file that has been defined in `themes/custom/yeebo_v1/yeebo_v1.libraries.yml`. Needs to be activated in `sites/default/default.settings.php` setting `$settings['maintenance_theme']` to `yeebo_v1`. Requires emptying of cache.

- Modified `.gitignore` and added `.editorconfig`
